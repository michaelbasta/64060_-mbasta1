# b. 
## Looking at the data from the centroids of the clusters
## Cluster 1: (Market_cap, Beta, PE_Ratio, Leverage, Rev_Growth) are Lower than average (negative values) and (ROE, ROA, Asset_Turnover, Net_Profit_Margin) are above average (Positive values)
## Cluster 2: (Market_cap, PE_Ratio, ROE, ROA, Asset_Turnover, Rev_Growth, Net_Profit_Margin) are Lower than average (negative values) and (Beta, Leverage) are above average (Positive values)
## Cluster 3:(Market_cap, Beta, ROE, ROA, Leverage, Rev_Growth) are Lower than average (negative values) and (PE_Ratio, Asset_Turnover) are above average (Positive values)
## Cluster 4: (Beta, PE_Ratio, Leverage) are Lower than average (negative values) and (Market_Cap, ROE, ROA, Asset_Turnover, Rev_Growth, Net_Profit_Margin) are above average (Positive values)
## Cluster 5:(Market_Cap, PE_Ratio, ROE, ROA, Asset_Turnover, Net_Profit_Margin) are Lower than average (negative values) and (Beta, Leveerage, Rev_Growth) are above average (Positive values)

# c.
## I don't see a pattern in the clusters with respect to the non-numerical variables

# d.
## Cluster 1: High returns and turnover
## Cluster 2: High leverage 
## Cluster 3: High Price/earnings ratio
## Cluster 4: High Market Capitalization and returns
## Cluster 5: High Revenew Growth
